# OpenLong
OpenLog is a source fork based on "Long (é¾™)"

This project is a fork from Comet and all rights over Comet are reserved by Gareth Jensen "Spirited".
It is also a reimagination of Canyon which may be a good thing (or not).
The project is split between three servers: an account server, game server and ai server. The account server authenticates players, while the game server services players in the game world and the ai server handles ai over the NPCs in the world. This simple three-server architecture acts as a good introduction into server programming and concurrency patterns. The server is interoperable with the Conquer Online game client, but a modified client will not be provided.
This still a work in progress and is not recommended to starters. No support will be given to creating events, NPCs or anything like that. But if you want to work with Canyon you may report bugs and we will keep the main repository updated with bug fixes to whoever wants to try it.
When the live server leaves the Beta Stage, we will start keeping stable versions of Canyon in the main main repository, if you download from development make sure you know what you are doing and that you are ready to face bugs.

-> Source Upgrade to version 6609
